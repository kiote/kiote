  # Hi, I'm Ekaterina!

  > *"A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm."*
  > — Isaac Asimov, First Law of Robotics

  PhD student at Tallinn University researching **Human-Computer Interaction**, **deep learning**, and **affective computing**—teaching machines to understand human emotions.

  Before research, I spent years building distributed systems, microservices, and cloud-native apps. Functional programming enthusiast who believes elegant code can change how we think about problems.

  ## What I'm Working On

  Building AI systems that genuinely help people—systems designed thoughtfully with human wellbeing at the center. Asimov's First Law still guides how I think about technology.
