  > *"A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm."*
  > — Isaac Asimov, First Law of Robotics

  PhD student at Tallinn University researching **Human-Computer Interaction**, **deep learning**, and **affective computing**—teaching machines to understand human emotions.

  Before research, I spent years building distributed systems, microservices, and cloud-native apps. Functional programming enthusiast who believes elegant code can change how we think about problems.

  ## What I'm Working On

  My PhD topic is related to neuro-symbolic AI, deep learning and deep knowledge tracing. I work as a part of [EduHAI research team](https://www.edu-hai.ee/team)

  ## Open Source Contributions

  Contributor to **[scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)** — the Python machine learning library. Merged PRs include performance improvements to MultiLabelBinarizer and estimator validation checks.

  For example: 
  
  1. https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/12116 — Cache class mapping in MultiLabelBinarizer (performance enhancement)
  2. https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/7846 — Add check for estimator: parameters not modified by fit
  3. https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/7553 — Ensure estimator __dict__ is unmodified by predict/transform
